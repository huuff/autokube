# Autokube
Working thorugh [Kubernetes: The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), but using my own servers and using `flannel` (from [these posts](https://veerendra2.github.io/kubernetes-the-hard-way-1/)).

I really dislike what this became but gets me through experimentation. Any attempt to fix it would mean a complete rewrite in something that's not bash.
